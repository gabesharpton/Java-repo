# Java-repo

This is a repo to test out some Java and potentially make a project from it. I have never used Java but have always been interested in it.

Java is an object oriented language (OOP). Java objects are part of so-called "Java classes". In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.

- public again means that anyone can access it.
- static means that you can run this method without creating an instance of Main.
- void means that this method doesn't return any value.
- main is the name of the method.

Although Java is object oriented, not all types are objects. It is built on top of basic variable types called primitives.

Here is a list of all primitives in Java:

- byte (number, 1 byte)
- short (number, 2 bytes)
- int (number, 4 bytes)
- long (number, 8 bytes)
- float (float number, 4 bytes)
- double (float number, 8 bytes)
- char (a character, 2 bytes)
- boolean (true or false, 1 byte)
